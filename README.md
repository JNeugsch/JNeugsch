- Hi, I am Jörg Neugschwender, Data Team Manager at Luxembourg Income Study asbl (LIS).
- LIS is the home of the cross-national world-wide databases Luxembourg Income Study (LIS) Database and Luxembourg Wealth Study (LWS) Database
- https://www.lisdatacenter.org/
  
- I am an advanced user of Stata, and partly knowledgable of the R coding logic.
- On this platform, I aim to make available well-structured Stata code which can be plugged into the remote access system LISSY.
- The provided documentation should make it easy to alter the code for own analyses.
